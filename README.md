Adaptive OS Scheduler for Real-Time Systems
Project Overview
The Adaptive OS Scheduler for Real-Time Systems is a project designed to develop a dynamic operating system scheduler that can adapt to the specific timing and resource constraints of real-time applications. Real-time systems require tasks to be completed within strict deadlines, making effective scheduling essential for ensuring system performance, reliability, and efficiency.

This project aims to build an OS scheduler that can dynamically adjust to varying system loads, task workloads, and resource availability, ensuring that tasks are executed promptly without missing their deadlines.

Features
Dynamic Task Prioritization: Tasks are prioritized dynamically based on urgency, deadlines, and system conditions.

Efficient Resource Management: CPU and memory resources are allocated efficiently to meet the timing requirements of tasks while minimizing wastage.

Task Migration and Load Balancing: Tasks are distributed across multiple processors or cores to ensure optimal performance and prevent bottlenecks.

Real-Time Scheduling Algorithms: Support for Earliest Deadline First (EDF) and Rate-Monotonic Scheduling (RMS) to handle task scheduling based on deadlines and task frequency.

Priority Inversion Handling: The system resolves priority inversion issues where lower-priority tasks block higher-priority ones.

Fault Tolerance: The scheduler can handle task failures and resource issues gracefully to maintain system stability.

Prerequisites
C or C++ programming language

Knowledge of operating system concepts (scheduling, task management, real-time systems)

A Linux-based system (for OS-level integration)

Development tools: GCC, Makefile, or an appropriate build toolchain
